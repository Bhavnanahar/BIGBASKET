# 🛒 **Big Basket Mini Project** 📊

Welcome to my **Data Analysis Project**! This project takes a deep dive into a **sales dataset** to uncover valuable insights, such as identifying best-selling products, calculating discounts, detecting outliers, and visualizing key trends. The analysis is performed using **Python** in a **Google Colab** environment.

## 💡 **Project Overview**

In this project, we analyze a sales dataset to:

- **Identify the top-selling and least-selling products**.
- **Measure the impact of discounts** on product sales.
- **Handle missing values** and **outliers** to clean the dataset.
- **Visualize the data** using graphs to reveal important patterns and trends.

By uncovering these insights, we can make informed decisions about product strategies, pricing, and marketing.

## 🛠️ **Technologies Used**

- **Python** - The programming language used to perform data analysis.
- **Pandas** - The powerful data manipulation library.
- **Matplotlib** & **Seaborn** - Libraries for creating beautiful and insightful visualizations.

## 📊 **Dataset Information**

The dataset contains sales information about various products. It includes:

- **Product Name**: Name of the product.
- **Sales Volume**: Number of units sold.
- **Price**: The price of each product.
- **Discount**: The discount applied to the product.

This data allows us to perform detailed analysis to improve decision-making for sales and marketing teams.

## 🎨 **Key Insights**

After conducting the analysis, here are some key insights derived from the data:

- **Top-selling Products**: The best-performing products based on total sales.
- **Discount Effectiveness**: How discounts impact sales for certain products.
- **Sales Distribution**: Visualizing how products compare in terms of units sold.
- **Outlier Detection**: Identifying data points that are out of the normal range and ensuring data integrity.

These insights can help businesses optimize their product offerings, pricing strategies, and marketing campaigns.

## 📈 **Visualizations**

We used **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn** to generate visually appealing graphs that highlight key findings:

- Bar charts for **top-selling products**.
- Line charts to track **sales trends** over time.
- Pie charts to show **sales distribution** across different categories

## 📥 **How to Run the Project**

To run this project on your own:

1. **Upload the dataset** to Google Colab.
2. Copy and paste the Python code provided in the notebook.
3. Run the cells to explore the dataset, analyze the data, and generate visualizations.

Ensure that all required libraries (`pandas`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`) are installed.
